# CircuitJS1

## Introduction

CircuitJS1 is an electronic circuit simulator that runs in the browser. It was originally written by Paul Falstad as a Java Applet. It was adapted by Iain Sharp to run in the browser using GWT.

For a hosted version of the application see:

## Building the web application

The web application can be compiled and run locally using Eclipse, or in a cloud development container like Github Codespaces or gitpod.io. Both of these services provide a number of free usage hours every month. You can also use the cloud tools from `./dev.sh` on your local Linux machine or in a local docker container.

### Development using Eclipse

The tools you will need to build the project are:

* Eclipse, Oxygen version.
* GWT plugin for Eclipse.

Install "Eclipse for Java developers" from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/). To add the GWT plugin for Eclipse follow the instructions [here](https://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/Download.html).

This repository is a project folder for your Eclipse project space. Once you have a local copy you can then build and run in development mode or build for deployment. Running in super development mode is done by clicking on the "run" icon on the toolbar and choosing http://127.0.0.1:8888/circuitjs.html from the "Development Mode" tab which appears. Building for deployment is done by selecting the project root node and using the GWT button on the Eclipse taskbar and choosing "GWT Compile Project...".

GWT will build its output in to the "war" directory. In the "war" directory the file "iframe.html" is loaded as an iFrame in to the spare space at the bottom of the right hand pannel. It can be used for branding etc.

### Development using cloud containers

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the appropriate remote extension: either [Gitpod Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gitpod.gitpod-desktop) or [Codespaces Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces).
2. Open your fork of the `circuitjs1` repository in your chosen provider's dev container.
3. This should open a new tab in your browser showing VS Code. Click in the green button in the bottom left corner, then select "Open in VS Code Desktop" in the popup menu that opened. Click "Allow" in all URL popups and authenticate using github if asked.

Once you have successfully connected your local VS Code to the remote workspace, you should be able to see the content of the remote container in your local VS Code. You can now continue with the setup:

4. Open a shell inside the dev container by pressing `Ctrl+Backtick` or pressing `F1` and typing "Create new Terminal".
5. Make sure you are in the folder `/workspaces/circuitjs1` inside the container (necessary only once per newly created container).
6. Run `./dev.sh setup` to install all development dependencies, including GWT and Java.
7. Run `./dev.sh start` to start the web server and the GWT code server. This will start two services: http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:9876.
8. Make sure both port and 8000 and 9876 are forwarded in the "Ports" tab (next to "Terminal").
9. If you edit a Java file in VS Code and reload http://localhost:8000, it should recompile the file automatically. It will then load the compiled JavaScript and the corresponding source map from the code server running on http://localhost:9876. You should be able to see the your changes in the web application.

> ***Note:*** When running the web application server inside a remote dev container, port forwarding is necessary in order to access the remote server from your own computer. This port forwarding is provided by Visual Studio Code running on your local computer.
>
> Theoretically, it would be possible to use the browser-based VS Code interface. However, both Gitpod and Codespaces map forwarded ports to different domain names instead of different ports, which confuses the GWT code loader. It is possible to fix this by live-patching the `serverUrl` variable in `circuitjs1.nocache.js` using a custom HTTP server, but it also requires setting the port visibility to "Public" to avoid CORS errors due to redirects. Using a local installation of VS Code is much simpler.

### Development using Gradle

Run `./build.sh` (or `gradle makeSite`) to compile both GWT and the breadboard
frontend and produce the complete static site. Requires Java, Gradle, Node.js
20.19+ and pnpm 10. The build synchronizes `site/`, removing obsolete output.

```bash
./build.sh
./serve.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. Do not open the HTML via `file://`.

### 统一发布目录（EdgeOne Makers / 自建服务器）

所有平台使用同一份 `site/` 产物：

```text
site/
├── index.html                 # 跳转到 /circuit/circuitjs.html
└── circuit/
    ├── index.html
    ├── circuitjs.html
    ├── login.html
    ├── activate.html
    ├── api.js
    ├── circuitjs1/
    ├── breadboard/
    │   ├── index.html
    │   └── assets/
    └── 其他静态资源
```

- **EdgeOne Makers**：完整上传 `site/` 的内容；发布根目录必须直接包含
  `index.html` 和 `circuit/`。若在平台构建，项目根目录设为本目录，构建命令
  为 `./build.sh`，输出目录为 `site`；构建环境须提供上述工具，否则本地构建后上传。
- **自建服务器**：把完整 `site/` 内容上传到网站根目录，使用普通静态文件服务。
  删除旧的 `location = /circuit` 和 `location ^~ /circuit/` alias 配置，
  由真实的 `circuit/` 目录处理请求。目录默认页使用 `index.html`。
- 不要配置把现有静态资源强制改写为根目录 `index.html` 的兜底规则。
- 旧版根路径入口改为 `/circuit/circuitjs.html`；网站首页会自动跳转。
- `site/` 是生成目录，不要直接维护其中的文件。首页源文件在 `deployment/index.html`。

发布后检查 `/circuit/login.html`、`/circuit/circuitjs.html` 和
`/circuit/breadboard/`，确认 `/circuit/breadboard/assets/` 的 JS 请求返回
JavaScript，而不是首页 HTML。登录后点击“实物仿真”，确认求解引擎正常连接。

面包板 Vite 联调方式见 [breadboard-simulation/README.md](breadboard-simulation/README.md)。

### 实物仿真的离线缓存与登录

- 实物仿真及内嵌求解器无需登录，不在启动、刷新或切回窗口时校验 token。
- 打开、保存、另存和删除云端项目时才使用 token；由项目接口校验身份与权限。
  未登录或接口返回 HTTP/业务码 401 时跳转 `/circuit/login.html`，保留本地工作区
  和登录回跳地址。网络故障不会清除 token 或触发登录跳转。
- `gradle makeSite` 生成带内容版本号的 Service Worker 和静态资源清单。
  首次联网打开实物仿真并完成资源缓存后，可断网刷新并继续运行求解器。
  尚未下载过的站点无法首次离线访问；云端项目操作仍需要网络。
- 带内容哈希的 JS/CSS 优先使用缓存；HTML 和其他静态文件联网时检查更新，
  断网时回退缓存。登录页、API 响应和不存在的路径不写入离线缓存。
- 新版本完整缓存成功后激活，清理旧版 `v1` 缓存，并保留上一版本的静态资源供
  已打开的页面使用。不删除用户登录信息、草稿或设置。

完整构建后的浏览器验证脚本为 `breadboard-simulation/e2e/offline_qa.py`，
需先在 `127.0.0.1:8766` 提供 `site/` 静态服务（Python Playwright）。


## Deployment of the web application

* Run `./build.sh` and deploy the complete `site/` output as described above. Do not deploy `war/` directly; it lacks the portable `/circuit/` directory layout.
* Customize the header of the file "circuitjs1.html" to include your tracking, favicon etc.
* Customize the "iframe.html" file to include any branding you want in the right hand panel of the application
* The optional file "shortrelay.php" is a server-side script to act as a relay to a URL shortening service to avoid cross-origin problems with a purely client solution. You may want to customize this for your site. If you don't want to use this feature edit the circuitjs1.java file before compiling.
* If you wish to enable dropbox loading and saving a dropbox API app-key is needed. This should be edited in to the circuitjs.html file where needed. If this is not included the relevant features will be disabled.


The link for the full-page version of the application is now:
`http://<your host>/<your path>/circuitjs1.html`
(you can rename the "circuitjs1.html" file if you want too though you should also update "shortrelay.php" if you do).

Just for reference the files should look like this

```
-+ Directory containing the front page (eg "circuitjs")
  +- circuitjs.html - full page version of application
  +- iframe.html - see notes above
  +- shortrelay.php - see notes above
  ++ circuitjs1 (directory)
   +- various files built by GWT
   +- circuits (directory, containing example circuits)
   +- setuplist.txt (index in to example circuit directory)
```

## Docker/podman containers

### Building and Running Circuitjs in docker containers

*(replace the podman command with docker if you prefere docker)*

- To build Docker image using podman: 

```
podman build -f circuitjs1.Containerfile -t circuitjs1:latest
```

- To then run Docker image using podman:

```
podman run --name=circuitjs1 --rm -d -p 8000:8000 circuitjs1:latest
```

CircuitJS1 should be accessable at: http://localhost:8000/circuitjs.html


### Development using docker containers

(replace the podman command with docker if you prefere docker)

- To build the development Docker image using podman: 

```
podman build -f dev-start.Containerfile -t circuitjs1-dev:latest
```

- To then run the development Docker image using podman:

```
podman run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000/tcp -p 127.0.0.1:9876:9876/tcp circuitjs1-dev:latest
```

CircuitJS1 should be accessable at: http://localhost:8000/circuitjs.html

If you need to modify the files while the container is running (using the gwt auto-build method):

```
podman run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/src:Z  -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000/tcp -p 127.0.0.1:9876:9876/tcp  circuitjs1-dev:latest
```

This will use the current directory inside the container.



## Embedding

You can link to the full page version of the application using the link shown above.

If you want to embed the application in another page then use an iframe with the src being the full-page version.

You can add query parameters to link to change the applications startup behaviour. The following are supported:
```
.../circuitjs.html?cct=<string> // Load the circuit from the URL (like the # in the Java version)
.../circuitjs.html?ctz=<string> // Load the circuit from compressed data in the URL
.../circuitjs.html?startCircuit=<filename> // Loads the circuit named "filename" from the "Circuits" directory
.../circuitjs.html?startCircuitLink=<URL> // Loads the circuit from the specified URL. CURRENTLY THE URL MUST BE A DROPBOX SHARED FILE OR ANOTHER URL THAT SUPPORTS CORS ACCESS FROM THE CLIENT
.../circuitjs.html?euroResistors=true // Set to true to force "Euro" style resistors. If not specified the resistor style will be based on the user's browser's language preferences
.../circuitjs.html?IECGates=true // Set to true to force IEC logic gates. If not specified the gate style will be based on the user's browser's language preferences
.../circuitjs.html?usResistors=true // Set to true to force "US" style resistors. If not specified the resistor style will be based on the user's browser's language preferences
.../circuitjs.html?whiteBackground=<true|false>
.../circuitjs.html?conventionalCurrent=<true|false>
.../circuitjs.html?running=<true|false> // Start the app without the simulation running, default true
.../circuitjs.html?hideSidebar=<true|false> // Hide the sidebar, default false
.../circuitjs.html?hideMenu=<true|false> // Hide the menu, default false
.../circuitjs.html?editable=<true|false> // Allow circuit editing, default true
.../circuitjs.html?positiveColor=%2300ff00 // change positive voltage color (rrggbb)
.../circuitjs.html?negativeColor=%23ff0000 // change negative voltage color
.../circuitjs.html?selectColor=%2300ffff // change selection color
.../circuitjs.html?currentColor=%23ffff00 // change current color
.../circuitjs.html?mouseWheelEdit=<true|false> // allow changing of values by mouse wheel
.../circuitjs.html?mouseMode=<item> // set the initial mouse mode.  can also initially perform other UI actions, such as opening the 'about' menu, running 'importfromlocalfile', etc.
.../circuitjs.html?hideInfoBox=<true|false>
```
The simulator can also interface with your javascript code.  See [war/jsinterface.html](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/jsinterface.html) for an example.

## Building an Electron application

The [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) project allows web applications to be distributed as local executables for a variety of platforms. This repository contains the additional files needed to build circuitJS1 as an Electron application.

The general approach to building an Electron application for a particular platform is documented [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-distribution). The following instructions apply this approach to circuit JS.

To build the Electron application:
* Compile the application using GWT, as above.
* Download and unpack a [pre-built Electron binary directory](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) version 9.3.2 for the target platform.
* Copy the "app" directory from this repository to the location specified [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-distribution) in the Electron binary directory structure.
* Copy the "war" directory, containing the compiled CircuitJS1 application, in to the "app" directory the Electron binary directory structure.
* Run the "Electron" executable file. It should automatically load CircuitJS1.

Known limitations of the Electron application:
* "Create short URL" on "Export as URL" doesn't work as it relies on server support.

Thanks to @Immortalin for the initial work in applying Electron to CircuitJS1.
